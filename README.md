Nim is a two-player strategy game played with row of matches (or stacks of coins, or piles ofstones).
Players take turns. The game is such that the computer never loses the game.
During a playerâ€™s turn they can remove one of more matchesfrom a row. They cannot remove matches from more than one row; and they must pick up atleast one match. 
The game ends when one player picks up the last match and, thereby, loses the game.
